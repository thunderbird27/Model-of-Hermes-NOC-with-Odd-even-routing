# Model of Hermes NOC with Odd-even routing
 Hermes Network-on-chip (NoC) specification model implemented in Promela, the input language of SPIN modelchecker for verification.
 
 The model of Hermes NoC with oddeven routing algorithm and xy routing algorithm in SPIN is used for estimating worstcase latency in NoC for the different routing algorithms.
 
 These models were used to estimate worst-case latency on all routing paths.
 1. Promela model is available in  *.pml file
 
 2. Python implementation (.py) to implemented to generated packets to SPIN model and log latency
 
 The result of research is available in :
